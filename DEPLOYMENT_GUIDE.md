# Vercel Auto-Deployment Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ Vision page crashing issues have been fixed
✅ Build process is working correctly
✅ Vercel configuration is properly set up

## Auto-Deployment Setup

### 1. Vercel Git Integration
To enable auto-deployment, ensure your project is connected to a Git repository:

1. **Connect to Git Repository:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Git
   - Connect to your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository

2. **Configure Branch Settings:**
   - Production Branch: `main` or `master`
   - Preview Branches: Enable for all branches
   - Auto-deploy: Enable for production branch

### 2. Environment Variables
If your project uses environment variables:
```bash
# Add these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
NODE_ENV=production
# Add any other required environment variables
```

### 3. Build Settings Verification
Your current `vercel.json` is correctly configured:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### 4. Deployment Hooks (Optional)
For manual deployments or CI/CD integration:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git
2. Copy the Deploy Hook URL
3. Use it in your CI/CD pipeline or for manual triggers

## Vision Page Fixes Applied

### Performance Optimizations:
- ✅ Removed heavy infinite animations that could cause memory leaks
- ✅ Simplified scroll progress indicator
- ✅ Optimized background decorative elements
- ✅ Added proper cleanup for event listeners

### Error Handling Improvements:
- ✅ Added client-side checks for window object (SSR compatibility)
- ✅ Implemented proper useEffect cleanup
- ✅ Added error boundaries for scroll handlers
- ✅ Separated concerns with multiple useEffect hooks

### Memory Leak Prevention:
- ✅ Proper timer cleanup in useEffect
- ✅ Passive scroll listeners for better performance
- ✅ DOM element cleanup on component unmount

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build process completes successfully
- [x] Vision page loads without crashes
- [x] Animations are smooth and performant
- [x] No memory leaks in scroll handlers
- [x] Proper cleanup on component unmount
- [x] SSR compatibility (window checks)

## Troubleshooting Auto-Deployment

If auto-deployment is not working:

1. **Check Git Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Verify your repository is connected
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Verify Webhook Settings:**
   - Ensure webhooks are enabled in your Git provider
   - Check Vercel has proper permissions

3. **Manual Deployment Test:**
   ```bash
   # Test manual deployment
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Check for any build failures or errors

## Next Steps

1. Push your changes to your Git repository
2. Verify auto-deployment triggers
3. Monitor the Vision page performance on production
4. Set up monitoring for any future issues
